    <p style="margin: 2.5%;"><i>"Lots of heat but not very much light. It came
        across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of
        the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really
        happened. Even that would not have been so bad but the movie tries to
        portray lots of these folks as sympathetic figures just trying to do the
        right thing."</p></i>
    <p style="margin: 2.5%;"><i>"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how
        this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their families,
        descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with
        absolutely no compassion."</p></i>
